# Legion of Deadites : Night of the Dead save files
##### Maintained by Carterpants. Contributions welcome via pull request
##### Saves compatible with current game version: **1.0.1.5051.alpha**  

## File Location  
The default save location is C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\LF\Saved\SaveGames  
(easily access this by Win + R, enter _appdata_)  

The folder name must match the prefix of the save files
> Example:  
Parent folder - C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\LF\Saved\SaveGames\Team2  
Files within - Team2.png, Team2_Level.sav, Team2_Player.sav, etc  

## Saving Habits
The game will autosave periodically, but you will lose a few hours IRL time if you depend on this. I advise manually saving before and after the nightly wave, a few times during the day, and/or right before you make a large structural change.  

Or, when someone yells "***BEAR***"
